### **Because things should be simple.**

## We believe in Test Driven Development and so we want to make it as simple as possible. And fun.

The main goal for Testacular is to bring a productive environment to developers. An environment, where they don't have to set up many things, and rather just write the code and get instant feedback. Because getting a quick feedback is what makes you productive and [creative].
